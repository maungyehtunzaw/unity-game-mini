I'll help you implement the specific requirements you've outlined. Let me create the home page with status bar, game list constants, and the two specific mini-games (tic-tac-toe and memory game), plus a splash screen. I'll start by creating the game list constants file to manage which games are enabled and available in your mini-game hub. This will provide easy configuration control over your game catalog. Perfect! Now I'll create the enhanced home page UI with a status bar showing coins, profile, and settings, plus a body section that lists the playable mini-games. Let me create the enhanced UI components: Now I'll create the supporting UI components for the enhanced home page: Now I need to update the EconomyService to support the HasPremiumAccess method: I need to add the HasPremiumAccess method to the EconomyService: 
```

```
Now I need to update the SaveData class to include the premiumAccess field: 
```

```
Perfect! Now I'll create the Tic-Tac-Toe mini-game as a complete modular game following our IMinigame interface: Perfect! Now I'll create the Memory Game mini-game, implementing a card matching game: Now I need to create the MemoryCard component that the MemoryGame uses: Perfect! Now I'll create the final component - an attractive splash screen for app startup: Now I'll create a comprehensive UI setup guide and scene setup documentation to help you implement these components: Perfect!
